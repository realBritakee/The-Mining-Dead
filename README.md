## Overview

In a post-apocalyptic world of decayed mining towns, survivors scavenge ruins, fortify colonies, and battle block-breaking zombies. Every noise risks a horde—mining deeper means greater rewards but deadlier threats.

- **Genre**: Survival / Colony Builder
- **Platform**: Hytale (Modpack + Dedicated Server)
- **Status**: Pre-Launch (Tied to Hytale Early Access, Jan 13, 2026)
- **Note**: Features depend on Hytale's modding APIs. Active development—join to help!

## Key Features

- **🧭 Scavenging**: Risky multi-level structures with noise attraction (mining alerts zombies). Loot tiers from rusty tools to rare tech.
- **🏘️ Colony Building**: Manage towns with NPCs, taxes, roles, and betrayals. Defend against sieges using upgradeable barricades (Wood → Steel).
- **🦠 Survival Mechanics**: Thirst, hunger, temperature, infection (bite → fever → amputation). Day/night cycles and weather amplify danger.
- **👾 Zombies**: Varieties like Walkers (slow breakers), Runners (fast climbers), Bloated (explosive), Armored (tanks), and massive Herds (300+ scaled by zones).
- **🚗 Vehicles**: Progress from Bicycle to Helicopter.
- **Other**: Trader caravans, bandit raids, reputation system, and mining integrations (tunnel collapses).
